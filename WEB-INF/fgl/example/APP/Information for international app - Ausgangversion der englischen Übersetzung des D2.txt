<h3>Information for international applicants starting their studies at TU Bergakademie Freiberg<br />
&nbsp;</h3>
Since applying for a visa can take several weeks or even months, it is recommended that you make an appointment with the relevant German embassy immediately after receiving your letter of admission and prepare all the necessary documents. Late applications can lead to significant delays to entry and the start of your studies, meaning that a smooth start cannot be guaranteed.<br />
&nbsp;
<h3>Enrollment without visa of study</h3>
Final enrolment in the first semester of an English-language study programme at TU Bergakademie Freiberg is initially possible without valid visa for study. If you arrive later than two weeks after the start of lectures, please note that the period of study will be extended accordingly. Late arrival may result in you missing important introductory events, course content or exam preparation, which can significantly delay your studies.<br />
