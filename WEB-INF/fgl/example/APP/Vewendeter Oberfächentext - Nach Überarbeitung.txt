<h3><strong>Information for international applicants starting their studies at TU Bergakademie Freiberg</strong></h3>
</div>
Since applying for a visa can take several weeks or even months, it is recommended that you make an appointment with the relevant German embassy immediately after receiving your letter of admission and prepare all the necessary documents. Late applications can lead to significant delays to entry and the start of your studies, meaning that a smooth start cannot be guaranteed.<br />

<h3><strong>Enrollment without visa of study</strong></h3>
</div>
